Complete the Tutorial Steps in the 'Basic JavaScript' Portion under 'JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification’. (Optional but recommended for your learning)

Part B (Lab Day):

Summary

Write a collection of mini-javascript programs that perform several small computations. Each requirement should reside in its own javascript file. Keep your files organized. Upload your change commits to GitHub and comment on your code.

It is suggested that you make a folder for each requirement that contains its index.html file along with an accompanying script.js file as has been done in class demonstrations. (Ex: Lab 1 Day 1 : Choice Computing)

You will be submitting your Git Hub Link to the repository for lab work to track your commits. 

General Requirements  

Write an if-else statement as on Brightspace and class in JavaScript that will receive a string as a parameter and then perform the following: 

You don’t have to prompt for a string. Simply assign a string to a variable in your code as your starting point to use as an argument for your statement.
If the person is in Halifax, list the airport and it's airport number, otherwise, ask them where they are located and where they are going? You could also do, if it is between the dates Jan 19 and Feb 19 I am traveling in Costa Rica, otherwise I am home in Halifax.
Next, add W3.CSS and Font Awesome CDN to an index.html file (these are CDN's). Use getelementbyId in JS to add the output on a website from the JS file as in class.
Finally, output in a div your console.log statement to the theme provided for this lab in a way that will benefit your final product. Be creative!
Use AI if needed for debugging/help and also use the resources in w3.css on W3Schools to be fancy!
